"Object-oriented programming is an attitude, not a tool." - Adam Osborne

This quote emphasizes the idea that OOP is not just a set of rules or techniques, but rather a way of thinking about software design and development. It requires a mindset shift to see software development as a collection of interconnected objects with their own properties and behaviors, rather than just a series of isolated procedures. OOP encourages developers to think in terms of modularity, encapsulation, and abstraction, which can lead to more flexible, maintainable, and reusable code.

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
