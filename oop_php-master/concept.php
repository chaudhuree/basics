key concepts of object-oriented programming in PHP that you should know as a beginner:

Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Classes can have properties and methods.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding implementation details from the user and providing only the necessary information. This is achieved through access modifiers like public, private, and protected.

Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This helps in reducing code duplication and promotes code reuse.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability to take on many forms. In PHP, this is achieved through method overloading and overriding.

Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of creating a simplified representation of something complex. In PHP, this is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

Method Overloading: Method overloading is the process of defining a method with the same name but with different parameters. This helps in providing different functionalities based on the parameters.

Method Overriding: Method overriding is the process of redefining a method in a child class with the same name as in the parent class. This helps in customizing the behavior of the method in the child class.

Static Methods and Properties: Static methods and properties belong to the class and not to the object. These can be accessed without creating an object.

Constructors and Destructors: Constructors are special methods that are called when an object is created, while destructors are special methods that are called when an object is destroyed.

Interfaces: An interface defines a contract that a class must follow. It specifies the methods that a class must implement.

These are some of the basic concepts of object-oriented programming in PHP that you should know as a beginner. Understanding these concepts will help you write better, more organized, and more efficient code.
