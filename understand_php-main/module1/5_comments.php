<!-- Comments in PHP
In programming, comments are a means to provide annotations to your code. These annotations are for the developer and anyone else who might be reading the code. Comments don't have any effect on the behavior of the program. In PHP, there are a few types of comments:

Single-line comments:
This is the most common type of comment. They start with either two forward slashes // or a hash symbol #.

Example: -->

<!-- 
// This is a single-line comment
# This is also a single-line comment
echo "Hello, World!"; // You can also have a comment after code on the same line
Multi-line comments:
For longer explanations or when commenting out multiple lines of code, you might prefer to use multi-line comments. These are encapsulated between /* and */.

Example: -->


<!-- /* 
This is a multi-line comment. 
It spans across several lines.
*/

echo "Hello, World!";

/*
echo "This code won't run.";
echo "Because it's commented out.";
*/
Comments for code documentation:
In professional PHP development, it's often good practice to use doc-blocks, which are a special kind of comment used to document the functionality of classes, methods, functions, variables, etc. They usually start with /** (note the double asterisk) and can contain special annotations that can be parsed by tools like phpDocumentor.

Example: -->

<!-- 
/**
 * Represents a User in our system.
 */
class User {
    /**
     * The user's first name.
     * 
     * @var string
     */
    private $firstName;

    /**
     * The user's last name.
     * 
     * @var string
     */
    private $lastName;

    /**
     * Create a new user instance.
     *
     * @param string $firstName The user's first name.
     * @param string $lastName  The user's last name.
     */
    public function __construct($firstName, $lastName) {
        $this->firstName = $firstName;
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
    }

    /**
     * Get the user's full name.
     *
     * @return string The user's full name.
     */
    public function getFullName() {
        return $this->firstName . ' ' . $this->lastName;
    }
}
ðŸ‘‰The above annotations like @var and @param help other developers understand the purpose and type of the variable or the purpose and type of the method's parameters.

In conclusion, comments are a valuable tool in any developer's toolkit. They help clarify intent, provide context, and aid in the understanding of the codebase. Remember, "Code is more often read than written," so always aim to make your code as understandable as possible for others (and for yourself in the future).
