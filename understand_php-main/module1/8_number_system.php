<!-- In computing, understanding different number systems is crucial. PHP, like many programming languages, can work with numbers in binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal systems. Let's explore each one and understand how to convert between them. -->

<!-- 1. Number Systems:
Decimal (Base 10)
The most familiar number system. Numbers are 0-9.

Example: -->


<!-- $decimal = 1234;


Binary (Base 2)
Uses only two digits: 0 and 1.

In PHP, a number prefixed with 0b (or 0B) is considered a binary number. -->

Example:

<!-- 
$binary = 0b1101;  // This is binary for 13 in decimal

Octal (Base 8)
Uses digits from 0-7.

In PHP, a number prefixed with 0 (a zero) is considered an octal number.

Example: -->


<!-- $octal = 012;  // This is octal for 10 in decimal
Hexadecimal (Base 16)
Uses digits from 0-9 and letters from A-F (or a-f) to represent values from 10 to 15.

In PHP, a number prefixed with 0x (or 0X) is considered a hexadecimal number. -->

<!-- Example:


$hexadecimal = 0xA3;  // This is hexadecimal for 163 in decimal -->

<!-- 2. Converting Between Number Systems:
PHP offers a few built-in functions that can assist in converting between number systems:

Decimal to Other Systems: -->

<!-- <?php

$decimal = 255;

// Decimal to Binary
$binary = decbin($decimal);  // Returns '11111111'
echo $binary;

// Decimal to Octal
$octal = decoct($decimal);  // Returns '377'
echo $octal;

// Decimal to Hexadecimal
$hexadecimal = dechex($decimal);  // Returns 'ff'

echo $hexadecimal;

?> -->


<!-- Other Systems to Decimal: -->

<!-- <?php
$binary = '11111111';
$octal = '377';
$hexadecimal = 'ff';

// Binary to Decimal
$decimalFromBinary = bindec($binary);  // Returns 255

// Octal to Decimal
$decimalFromOctal = octdec($octal);  // Returns 255

// Hexadecimal to Decimal
$decimalFromHex = hexdec($hexadecimal);  // Returns 255

?> -->

<!-- 
Note: Converting between non-decimal systems directly usually requires conversion to decimal as an intermediary step.

Practice:
Try converting a number between these systems. For example, take the number 29 in decimal and convert it to binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Then try converting those results back to decimal to check your work.

Tip: Always be aware of the base of the number you are working with and the base of the target number system. Knowing the rules for each system is crucial for successful conversions. -->
