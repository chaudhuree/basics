<!-- Let's dive into the ternary operator in PHP.

Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand for the if-else statement. It's a concise way to evaluate one of two expressions based on the truthiness of a condition. The general syntax for the ternary operator is: -->

<!-- $variable = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
Here's how it breaks down:

condition: This is the expression that's being checked.
value_if_true: The value that $variable will be assigned if the condition is true.
value_if_false: The value that $variable will be assigned if the condition is false.
Example:
Let's say you have a variable $age, and you want to assign a variable $status as either "minor" or "adult" based on the value of $age. -->

<!-- Using if-else:

if ($age < 18) {
    $status = "minor";
} else {
    $status = "adult";
}
Using ternary operator: -->

<!-- <?php
$age=19;

$status = ($age < 18) ? "minor" : "adult";

?> -->


<!-- Both of the above will give you the same result. The ternary operator simply offers a more concise way to write it. -->

<!-- Elvis Operator (?:)
PHP also offers an even shorter form of the ternary operator, commonly referred to as the "Elvis operator". It is used to return its first operand if it exists and is truthy, otherwise it returns its second operand.

Syntax: -->

<!-- <?php
$result = $value ?: 'default';

?> -->


<!-- This is essentially the same as: -->

<!-- <?php
$result = ($value) ? $value : 'default';

?> -->


<!-- Example:
Let's say you have a form where a user can enter their username, but if they leave it blank, you want to assign a default value. -->
<!-- 
<?php
$usernameInput = $_POST['username'];
$username = $usernameInput ?: 'Guest';


?> -->


<!-- In this case, if $usernameInput is non-empty (i.e., truthy), then $username will be assigned its value. Otherwise, $username will be 'Guest'. -->

<!-- Null Coalescing Operator (??)
PHP 7 introduced another operator related to ternary, called the null coalescing operator (??). It returns its first operand if it exists and is not null; otherwise, it returns its second operand. -->

<!-- Syntax: -->

<!-- <?php
$result = $value ?? 'default';

?> -->

<!-- Example:
Let's consider the earlier example with the user input. Using the null coalescing operator: -->

<!-- <?php
$usernameInput = $_POST['username'] ?? 'Guest';

?> -->


<!-- This means that if $_POST['username'] is set and is not null, $usernameInput will have its value. Otherwise, $usernameInput will be 'Guest'.

Conclusion
The ternary operator and its related shorthand versions (?: and ??) provide a concise way to evaluate conditions in PHP. They're especially handy for simple if-else checks, but for more complex logic, sticking to traditional if-else or switch statements is advisable for clarity. -->
