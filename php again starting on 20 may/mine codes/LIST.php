<!-- In PHP, the term "list" is often used interchangeably with "array." However, there are some conceptual and syntactic differences between the two.

Structure: An array is a data structure that can store multiple values in a single variable, while a list is a sequence of elements.

Syntax: In PHP, an array can be created using the array() construct or the shorter [] syntax. For example: -->

$array1 = array("item1", "item2", "item3");
// or
$array2 = ["item1", "item2", "item3"];

echo $array1;

<!-- On the other hand, a list is usually used as a way to assign multiple variables in a single line. It uses the list() construct. For example: -->

list($var1, $var2, $var3) = ["item1", "item2", "item3"];


<!-- In this case, the values "item1", "item2", and "item3" are assigned to the variables $var1, $var2, and $var3, respectively. -->
