<!-- The __isset() magic method in PHP is used to customize the behavior of the isset() function when it is called on an object property. It is triggered when the isset() function is used on a property that is not accessible or doesn't exist. The method takes one argument, which is the name of the property being checked with isset(). -->

<!-- For example, if you have a class "MyClass" with a private property "myProperty" and you use the isset() function to check if it is set, then the __isset() method is called automatically. -->

<?php
class MyClass
{
  private $myProperty = "Hello";

  public function __isset($property)
  {
    if (isset($this->$property)) {
      echo "Checking if $property is set" . PHP_EOL;
      return true;
    } else {
      echo "Checking if $property is set" . PHP_EOL;
      return false;
    }
  }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
echo isset($obj->myProperty) . PHP_EOL;
echo isset($obj->nonexistentProperty);

//output:
// Checking if myProperty is set 
// 1
// Checking if nonexistentProperty is set
// 0 or blank line
//
?>
<!-- 
It's important to note that the __isset() method is only called when the property is not accessible. If the property is public, the __isset() method will not be called. -->
